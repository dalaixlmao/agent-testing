  - Password reset process reduced to 3 or fewer steps
  - Clear user messaging throughout the process
  - Support tickets related to password resets decrease by 40%
- **Technical Notes**: Update Auth Service flows

### F004: Database Performance Optimization
- **Description**: Optimize database queries to reduce page load time by 50%
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Page load time reduced by at least 50% on dashboard pages
  - Query optimization applied to all critical user paths
  - No regression in data accuracy or functionality
- **Technical Notes**: Focus on query optimization, index improvements

### F009: API Rate Limiting
- **Description**: Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Rate limits applied based on user tiers
  - Clear error messages when limits are exceeded
  - Monitoring dashboard updated with rate limit metrics

  - Shortcuts implemented for navigation, editing, and viewing actions
  - Help menu updated with keyboard shortcut reference
  - Shortcuts work consistently across supported browsers
- **Technical Notes**: No dependencies identified

## Deferred Items

1. **F011: Advanced Search Filters** (Priority Score: 7,083)
   - Reason: Good candidate but lower priority than performance and stability issues
   - Plan: Schedule for next sprint

2. **F010: User Onboarding Tutorial** (Priority Score: 3,200)
   - Reason: Important for reducing support load, but requires UI/UX resources not available this sprint
   - Plan: Design work can begin during this sprint for implementation in the next sprint

3. **F005: Dark Mode Theme** (Priority Score: 8,925)
   - Reason: Popular user request but not critical for core functionality
   - Plan: Schedule for next sprint after performance issues are resolved

## Cut Items

1. **F002: AI Chat Assistant** (Priority Score: 4,800)
   - Reason: Despite being a CEO priority, this feature requires significant effort (8 days) that exceeds our sprint capacity
   - Plan: Break down into smaller components and reconsider for future sprints

2. **F007: Two-Factor Authentication** (Priority Score: 9,000)
   - Reason: Important security feature but requires 7 days of effort, exceeding sprint capacity
   - Plan: Schedule for dedicated security sprint in the near future

3. **F017: Real-time Collaboration** (Priority Score: 675)
   - Reason: Technically challenging (12 days) with low confidence (30%)
   - Plan: Move to research phase to reduce technical uncertainty before scheduling

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| OAuth fix complexity may exceed estimates | Medium | High | Begin with focused investigation on day 1; escalate early if complexity increases |
| Database optimization may cause unforeseen issues | Medium | High | Implement changes incrementally with rollback plan for each change; thorough testing in staging environment |
| API rate limiting may impact legitimate heavy users | Low | Medium | Configure reasonable thresholds based on historical usage data; monitor closely after deployment |
| Resource contention if critical bugs emerge | Medium | Medium | Reserve 10% capacity for emergency fixes; reprioritize if needed |

## Success Metrics

- **User Impact**: Login success rate increases to 99.9%
- **Performance**: Average page load time decreases by 50%
- **Support**: Password reset related support tickets decrease by 40%
- **Stability**: Zero API-related outages or performance degradations

## Dependencies

- Auth Service access required for F001 and F016
- Database administrator consultation needed for F004
- API Gateway configuration access needed for F009

## Daily Check-in Focus

- **Day 1**: Confirm understanding of login crashes; begin database analysis
- **Day 2**: Review progress on login fix; discuss any API rate limiting design questions
- **Day 3**: Ensure database optimization approach is sound; review password reset flow mockups
- **Day 4**: Address any blockers; ensure testing plans are in place
- **Day 5**: Verify fixes work in staging; prepare deployment plan
- **Day 6**: Deploy and monitor; document any follow-up work
