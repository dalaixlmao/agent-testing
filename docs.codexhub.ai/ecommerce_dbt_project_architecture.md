# E-Commerce dbt Project Architecture

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the e-commerce dbt project architecture, designed to address data quality issues and slow analytics delivery while ensuring a reliable, scalable data platform.

## Key Architecture Components

### 1. Modular Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns:

```
ecommerce_dbt/
├── analyses/             # Ad-hoc analytical queries
├── macros/              # Reusable SQL code
├── models/              # Data transformation logic
│   ├── staging/         # Source data cleaning
│   ├── intermediate/    # Business logic layer
│   └── marts/           # Dimensional models
│       ├── core/        # Core business entities
│       ├── marketing/   # Marketing analytics models
│       └── finance/     # Financial reporting models
├── seeds/               # Static reference data
├── snapshots/           # Type-2 SCD implementations
└── tests/               # Data quality tests
    ├── generic/         # Reusable test definitions
    └── singular/        # One-off specific tests
```

### 2. Dimensional Modeling Implementation

The project implements a classic dimensional modeling approach:

- **Staging Layer**: Standardizes and cleans source data
  - One-to-one mapping with source tables
  - Basic data type casting and null handling
  - Simple data quality checks
  - Implemented as views for minimal storage impact

- **Intermediate Layer**: Encapsulates shared business logic
  - Aggregations and derivations used across multiple marts
  - Implemented as ephemeral models (compiled into dependent queries)
  - Focuses on reusability and avoids logic duplication

- **Mart Layer**: Business-ready dimensional models
  - Dimension tables (customers, products, dates)
  - Fact tables (orders, order items, marketing performance)
  - Organized by business domain (core, marketing, finance)
  - Implemented as tables with appropriate indexes/partitioning

### 3. Data Quality Framework

A comprehensive testing framework ensures data reliability:

- **Source Tests**: Validates raw data integrity
  - Uniqueness and not-null constraints
  - Source freshness monitoring
  - Referential integrity checks

- **Custom Tests**: Domain-specific validations
  - Value range tests
  - Date recency tests
  - Proportion-based not-null tests
  - Cross-model consistency checks

- **Documentation**: Self-documenting models
  - Detailed column and model descriptions
  - Ownership information
  - Data lineage documentation

### 4. Performance Optimization

The project implements several performance optimizations:

- **Materialization Strategy**:
  - Staging models as views (lightweight, always current)
  - Intermediate models as ephemeral (no storage, compiled into dependent models)
  - Mart models as tables (optimized for query performance)

- **Snowflake Optimizations**:
  - Partition keys on date fields for fact tables
  - Clustering keys on high-cardinality foreign keys
  - Appropriate indexing on dimension tables

- **Incremental Loading**:
  - Support for incremental loads in appropriate models
  - Avoids full table rebuilds for large datasets

### 5. CI/CD Integration

Automated workflows ensure code quality and reliable deployments:

- **Continuous Integration**:
  - Automatic SQL linting
  - Compilation checks
  - Test execution on PR creation
  - Schema validation

- **Deployment Pipeline**:
  - Development → Staging → Production progression
  - Environment-specific configuration
  - Rollback capabilities

## Data Flow

1. Raw data lands in the `ecommerce_raw` schema
2. Staging models standardize and clean this data
3. Intermediate models perform business logic transformations
4. Mart models structure data into dimensional tables
5. BI tools and reporting applications connect to the mart models

## Monitoring and Observability

- Source freshness checks alert when data falls behind expected latency
- Row count and null value proportion tests detect unexpected data changes
- Cross-model consistency tests ensure logical agreement between facts and dimensions

## Scaling Considerations

- The architecture supports horizontal scaling as data volumes grow
- Incremental loading patterns reduce processing time for large tables
- Materialization strategies optimize for both refresh speed and query performance
- Clean separation of layers allows for targeted optimization

## Future Enhancements

- Implementation of data masking for PII in development environments
- Enhanced data quality monitoring dashboard
- Automated data dictionary generation
- Integration with data observability platforms
